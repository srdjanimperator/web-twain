		/// that enter the application’s main event loop. This allows the Source to update its user interface
		/// in real-time and to return messages to the application which cause state transitions. Even if the
		/// application overrides the Source’s user interface, it must forward all events once the Source has
		/// been enabled. The Source will tell the application whether or not each event belongs to the
